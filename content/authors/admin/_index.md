I am currently a second-year graduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology in China, studying in the School of Instrument Science and Engineering, majoring in Instrument Science and Technology.

Under the supervision of Prof. [Liyan Qiao](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/qiaoliyan) and associate Prof. [Ning Fu](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/funing), I am engaged in theoretical research in the field of signal processing, mainly focusing on inverse problems such as phase retrieval, sub-Nyquist sampling and direction-of-arrival estimation.
