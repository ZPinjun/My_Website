- Designed and developed a small and easy to carry testing electronic system for electrical load of civil aviation aircraft.

- Designed an embedded circuit board based on ZYNQ to collect and calculate the effective value of multi-channel AC, and to transmit the calculation results to the upper computer which could reduced the calculation load of the upper computer.

- Achieved >100 ksps sampling rate of the single channel and the effective value acquisition error <0.5%, and could provide up to 64 AC parallel acquisition.

The following are some of the results (in Chinese):
